This code will take a list of flight routes between some OD Pair and perform
textual analysis on it.  Specifically, it pulls out groupings of four contiguous
flight route points and determines which groupings occurs most frequently in the
data.  This should help look for commonalities amongst different routes.

*************************VERY IMPORTANT**************************
The comma-delimited file cotaining the flight routes will likely need to be
modified slightly from that obtained via Tableua.  Specifically, we need to 
ensure that all points along each route are separated by a single period '.'.
Some points are separated by two periods '..'.  Make necessary replacements in the
data to ensure that only one period '.' separates flight route points.
